### Purpose of This Case Study

This case study outlines the UX design process for a mobile Health Companion Super App aimed at helping individuals with chronic health conditions manage their medications and doctor appointments.

The objective of this case study is not to build a fully functioning application, but to demonstrate a structured, user-centred design process including research planning, persona development, journey mapping, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and reflection.

---

### The Problem

Individuals with chronic conditions often struggle to:

- Remember medication schedules
- Track medication intake consistently
- Manage multiple doctor appointments
- Keep medical information organized
- Communicate efficiently with healthcare providers

Existing solutions are often:

- Overly complex
- Not designed with elderly users in mind
- Fragmented across multiple platforms
- Emotionally overwhelming

Medication non-adherence is a serious issue that can lead to worsening health conditions and increased stress.

---

### The Goal

Design a mobile application that:

- Allows users to set medication reminders
- Tracks medication adherence
- Enables appointment scheduling
- Facilitates communication with healthcare professionals
- Reduces cognitive load
- Promotes confidence and control over personal health

The app must prioritize simplicity, accessibility, and emotional reassurance.

## User Research Discovery

### Research Strategy

Because this case study focuses on the UX design process rather than real data collection, the following research methods describe how I would gather insights in both quantitative and qualitative fashion.

---

### Online Survey

**Objective:**
Identify broad patterns in medication management habits and technology usage.

**Target Audience:**
- Adults 25–75 years old
- Diagnosed with at least one chronic condition
- Using at least one daily medication

**Estimated Participants:**
20–40 respondents

**Example Survey Topics:**
- How many medications do you take daily?
- How do you currently remember medication?
- Have you ever missed a dose? Why?
- How do you schedule doctor appointments?
- What frustrates you about managing your health?
- Comfort level using mobile apps (1–5 scale)

**Expected Outcomes:**
This method would help uncover common pain points, usage patterns, and demographic trends.

---

### Semi-structured Interviews

**Objective:**
Understand emotional experiences, routines, and deeper usability concerns.

**Participants:**
5–8 users from different age groups

**Duration:**
20–30 minutes per interview

**Example Interview Questions:**

- Accessibility concerns
- Technology adoption barriers
- Design priorities

## User Personas

### Persona 1: Maria Thompson

**Age:** 67  
**Location:** Toledo, Ohio  
**Background:** Retired elementary school teacher  
**Condition:** Type 2 Diabetes (diagnosed 8 years ago)  
**Tech Comfort:** Moderate  
**Living Situation:** Lives alone in a two-bedroom ranch home

**Personal Background:**
Maria grew up in a small farming community outside Toledo and spent 35 years teaching third grade at Lincoln Elementary. She's been widowed for four years since her husband Robert passed away from a heart attack. Their two adult children live in different states - her daughter Sarah is a nurse in Denver, and her son Michael works in tech in Seattle. Maria has three grandchildren she adores and video calls with weekly. She learned to use an iPad during the pandemic to stay connected with family and has become comfortable with basic apps like FaceTime, email, and Facebook.

Maria's daily routine revolves around her medication schedule, morning walks in the neighborhood, and afternoon gardening. She's methodical and likes structure, but struggles when her routine is disrupted by doctor appointments or social events. Her biggest fear is having a diabetic emergency when alone.

#### Goals
- Never miss insulin doses or blood sugar monitoring
- Track blood sugar readings and share them with her daughter Sarah
- Keep all doctor appointments organized in one place
- Feel confident managing her health independently without burdening her children
- Maintain her active lifestyle while staying safe

#### Pain Points
- Confusing app interfaces with too many buttons
- Small fonts that strain her eyes, especially in the evening
- Too many notifications that make her anxious
- Forgetting medication when her routine changes (doctor visits, social events)
- Technology that makes her feel "stupid" or overwhelmed

#### How She Would Use the App
- Sets recurring medication reminders for morning insulin and evening pills
- Logs medication with one-tap confirmation using large, clear buttons
- Views upcoming appointments on a simple dashboard
- Uses large-text accessibility mode and high contrast settings
- Shares blood sugar trends with her daughter through the app

### Persona 2: Daniel Lee

**Age:** 38  
**Location:** Austin, Texas  
**Background:** Senior Marketing Manager at a fintech startup  
**Condition:** Hypertension (diagnosed 3 years ago after a stressful product launch)  
**Tech Comfort:** High  
**Living Situation:** Lives with partner Alex in a downtown condo

**Personal Background:**
Daniel is a first-generation Korean-American who grew up in Los Angeles. His parents immigrated from Seoul in the 1980s and ran a small grocery store. He earned his MBA from UT Austin and stayed in the city for its thriving tech scene. Daniel is ambitious, detail-oriented, and slightly Type-A, which contributed to his hypertension diagnosis during a particularly stressful period at work.

Daniel discovered his hypertension during a routine physical when his doctor noticed consistently high readings. The diagnosis was a wake-up call that forced him to confront his stress levels and lifestyle choices. He's committed to managing his condition but refuses to let it slow down his career ambitions or social life.

He's extremely tech-savvy, early adopter of new apps and gadgets, and expects seamless digital experiences. Daniel gets frustrated with poorly designed interfaces and abandons apps that don't provide immediate value.

#### Goals
- Manage medication discreetly without colleagues knowing about his condition
- Receive smart, context-aware reminders that work with his unpredictable schedule
- Monitor medication adherence and blood pressure trends to share with his doctor
- Schedule appointments quickly between meetings, preferably virtual ones
- Integrate health management seamlessly into his existing digital workflow

#### Pain Points
- Forgetting medication while traveling across time zones for work
- Managing health alongside 60-hour work weeks and social commitments
- Switching between multiple health platforms (pharmacy app, doctor portal, fitness tracker)
- Apps that are too "medical" and make him feel like a patient rather than a person
- Privacy concerns about health data, especially regarding employer health insurance

#### How He Would Use the App
- Receives smart push notifications that adapt to his calendar and location
- Uses quick-log medication feature during brief moments between meetings
- Checks adherence analytics and blood pressure trends during commute
- Schedules virtual appointments during lunch breaks or early morning
- Syncs data with fitness tracker and shares reports with healthcare providers

## Usability Testing Plan

### Testing Goals

The primary goal of testing would be to determine whether users can complete essential tasks independently and without confusion. Since this application targets individuals managing chronic conditions, usability must be intuitive and stress-free. Therefore, the testing would specifically assess whether users can navigate the interface easily, understand the language used, and complete core actions efficiently.

---

### Participants

I would recruit six participants representing two key user groups: older adults (60+) and younger adults (25–45). This ensures the prototype is evaluated across varying levels of technological comfort.

- 3 users aged 60+
- 3 users aged 25–45

---

### User Tasks

During the session, participants would be asked to complete realistic scenarios rather than abstract tasks. For example, they might be instructed to:

1. Add a new daily medication
2. Log a medication as "taken"
3. Schedule a doctor appointment
4. Send a message to a healthcare provider

---

### Test Metrics

- Observational notes (where users pause, hesitate, or misclick)
- Time taken on task
- Number of errors
- Whether tasks were completed successfully

---

### Feedback Analysis Process

After testing, I would analyze the findings by identifying recurring friction points. Particular attention would be given to:

- Steps where multiple users hesitate
- Buttons that are overlooked
- Terminology that causes confusion
- Navigation patterns that feel unintuitive

Issues would then be prioritized by severity. High-severity issues (preventing task completion) would be addressed immediately, while moderate issues (minor confusion) would inform refinement of labels, layout, or visual hierarchy. The design would then be iterated based on this feedback. For example, if users struggle to locate the "Add Medication" button, it might be repositioned, resized, or visually emphasized. If the calendar interface creates confusion, it could be simplified into a more linear scheduling flow.

## Reflection

### How the UX Process Helped

Following a structured UX design process fundamentally shaped how I approached this project. Rather than beginning with interface ideas, I was required to slow down and consider user behaviours, emotional states, and contextual constraints. Planning the research methods first forced me to think about how real users manage chronic conditions and what invisible frustrations they experience daily. Developing personas clarified that this app would not serve a single type of user, but individuals with different technological comfort levels, routines, and emotional needs. The user journey maps further highlighted that managing health is not just a functional task, it carries anxiety, responsibility, and cognitive load. As a result, many of my design decisions shifted from adding features to reducing friction. The UX process transformed the app from a collection of tools into a structured support system built around clarity, reassurance, and ease of use.

### Challenges Encountered and How I Addressed Them

| Challenge | Why It Was a Problem | How I Addressed It |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Balancing Simplicity with Functionality | A health management app requires multiple features (reminders, scheduling, tracking, messaging). Displaying all features at once risked overwhelming users and increasing cognitive load, especially for older adults. | I simplified the home dashboard to show only time-sensitive and actionable information: today's medications and the next appointment. Secondary features (analytics, detailed logs) were moved into separate screens. This preserved functionality while reducing visual clutter. |
| Designing for Two Contrasting Personas | Maria requires clarity and guidance, while Daniel prioritizes speed and efficiency. Designing heavily for one persona could alienate the other. | Instead of building separate modes, I focused on universal usability principles. I used larger touch targets, clear typography, and high contrast (benefiting Maria), while ensuring core actions like logging medication require only one tap (supporting Daniel's efficiency needs). |
| Reducing Emotional Friction | Health management carries anxiety and responsibility. Users may fear making mistakes when logging medication or scheduling appointments. Poor design could amplify stress. | I introduced strong confirmation states (clear visual feedback after logging medication) and avoided medical jargon during onboarding. Language was simplified, and actions were made reversible when possible to reduce fear of error. |
| Preventing Cognitive Overload During Onboarding | Asking users to input too much information at once during setup could create hesitation or abandonment. | I structured onboarding as a guided, step-by-step process rather than a single long form. Information is broken into small, manageable inputs to reduce intimidation and encourage completion. |
| Designing Without Real Testing Data | Because this case study outlines the process rather than reporting real user results, I could not rely on measured usability issues. | I used scenario-based thinking and mapped realistic tasks during usability planning. By anticipating where friction might occur (e.g., locating "Add Medication"), I built iteration strategies into the design process from the beginning. |
